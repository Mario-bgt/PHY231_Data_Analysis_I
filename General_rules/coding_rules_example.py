don't: things that are bad. They may affect the evaluation negatively
always: do it like that, always. If you have a good reason to deviate, please ask the assistant. If not, it *may* reduces the points.
never: don't do this, never. If you find yourself compelled to do it, please discuss with the assistant. If not, it *may* reduces the points.
